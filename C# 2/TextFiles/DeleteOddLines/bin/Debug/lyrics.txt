 When I look into your eyes
But darlin' when I hold you

And we both know hearts can change
In the cold November rain
We've been through this such a long long time

An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today

To lay it on the line
Just knowin' that you were mine
So if you want to love me
Or I'll just end up walkin'

Do you need some time...all alone
On their own

When even friends seem out to harm you
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time...on my
Sometimes I need some time...all alone
On their own

And shadows still remain
When there's no one left to blame
We still can find a way
Even cold November rain
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
