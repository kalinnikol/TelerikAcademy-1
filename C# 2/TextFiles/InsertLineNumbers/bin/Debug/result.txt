1.  When I look into your eyes
2. I can see a love restrained
3. But darlin' when I hold you
4. Don't you know I feel the same
5. 
6. 'Cause nothin' lasts forever
7. And we both know hearts can change
8. And it's hard to hold a candle
9. In the cold November rain
10. 
11. We've been through this such a long long time
12. Just tryin' to kill the pain
13. 
14. But lovers always come and lovers always go
15. An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
16. Walking away
17. 
18. If we could take the time
19. To lay it on the line
20. I could rest my head
21. Just knowin' that you were mine
22. All mine
23. So if you want to love me
24. Then darlin' don't refrain
25. Or I'll just end up walkin'
26. In the cold November rain
27. 
28. Do you need some time...on your own
29. Do you need some time...all alone
30. Everybody needs some time...
31. On their own
32. Don't you know you need some time...all alone
33. 
34. I know it's hard to keep an open heart
35. When even friends seem out to harm you
36. But if you could heal a broken heart
37. Wouldn't time be out to charm you
38. 
39. Sometimes I need some time...on my
40. Own
41. Sometimes I need some time...all alone
42. Everybody needs some time...
43. On their own
44. Don't you know you need some time...all alone
45. 
46. And when your fears subside
47. And shadows still remain
48. I know that you can love me
49. When there's no one left to blame
50. So never mind the darkness
51. We still can find a way
52. 'Cause nothin' lasts forever
53. Even cold November rain
54. 
55. Don't ya think that you need somebody
56. Don't ya think that you need someone
57. Everybody needs somebody
58. You're not the only one
59. You're not the only one
